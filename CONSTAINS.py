2. Write a short message or send a 15-second audio message about what youâ€™re going to do in your creative hour. You can also video chat, if you feel like it.

3. Start your creative hour!

4. Come back in an hour to share your results (or sometimes lack thereof!) and cheer your co-workers on (either way!).
